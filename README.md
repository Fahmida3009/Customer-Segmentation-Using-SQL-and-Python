## About the Project

Customer segmentation is a key technique in understanding different customer groups and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly. This project uses a structured approach to analyze customer data, clean it with SQL, and visualize meaningful patterns with Tableau.

---

## Key Insights

- Customers with a high spending score tend to have smaller family sizes.
- Work experience and marital status significantly influence spending behavior.

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following attributes:
- **Demographics**: Gender, age, marital status, and graduation status.
- **Professional Details**: Profession and years of work experience.
- **Spending Behavior**: Spending segment (high, medium, low) and family size.
- **Unique Identifier**: Customer ID.

---

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: For data cleaning, handling missing values, and structuring the dataset for analysis.
- **Tableau**: For building an interactive dashboard to visualize customer segments and trends.

---

## Process

1. **Data Cleaning with SQL**:
   - Removed duplicate entries and handled missing values.
  
   



# Customer Segmentation Project

This project focuses on segmenting customers using SQL for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization. The goal is to derive actionable insights and better understand customer behaviors through interactive dashboards and data analysis.

---

## Data Visualization with Tableau

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau.
   - Designed interactive dashboards with filters for customer attributes like gender, age, and spending segment.

2. **Dashboards and Visualizations**:
   - Visualized trends, distributions, and correlations among customer groups.

---

## Visualizations

### Spending Trends:
- **Bar Charts**: Display spending scores by age group and profession and family size.
- **Line Charts**: Track spending trends over work experience.

### Demographic Segmentation:
- **Pie Charts**: Show proportions of customers by gender.

### Family Size vs. Spending:
- **Scatter Plots**: Illustrate the relationship between family size and spending behavior.



## Features
